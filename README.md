# Hotel-Management-System
A Python &amp; MySQL-based Hotel Management System for handling customer registration, room booking, food services, and login/registration with an interactive GUI. Demonstrates DBMS concepts with real-world hotel operations.

📝 Description

The Hotel Management System (DBMS) is a Python and MySQL-based project developed to streamline hotel operations by integrating core services into a single platform. The system provides an efficient way to manage customers, rooms, bookings, and services while offering a simple and user-friendly interface.

With this system, hotel staff can easily register new customers, allocate rooms, track availability, and manage check-in/check-out processes. It also includes a secure login and registration module to ensure only authorized users can access the system. The project incorporates image-based UI elements to create an engaging experience and make the system more intuitive.

At its core, the project demonstrates the practical application of Database Management Systems (DBMS), making it a valuable learning tool for students and developers. It shows how Python can be integrated with MySQL to build real-world applications that involve data storage, retrieval, and management.

Key Highlights:

🔑 Login & Registration – Ensures secure user authentication.
🏨 Room Management – Tracks available and booked rooms.
👤 Customer Management – Stores personal and booking details.
🍴 Food & Services – Adds hotel services for customers.
🗄 MySQL Integration – Demonstrates relational database operations.
🖼 Interactive GUI – Uses images and forms for better usability.

This project is particularly useful for:
